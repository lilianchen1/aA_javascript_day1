# Javascript exercises

Implemented many of the ruby exercises from week1 in javascript

#### Sample exercises:

1. recursion
  * make change
    - It's a function that takes in an array and a number. It returns the LEAST amount of numbers from the array that adds up to the number. make_change(14, [10, 7, 1]) returns [7, 7], not [10, 1, 1, 1].
  * merge sort
  * binary search
  * first n fibonacci numbers

2. array methods
 * myMap
 * myInject

3. javascript objects
 * define objects
 * define methods on object's prototype
 * pass objects into other objects

To test the code, run `node fileName.js`
